Welcome to EncryptionApp, a tool for encrypting and decrypting messages. Please carefully read the following instructions to operate the program correctly.

**Features**

-> Encryption: Convert your message into an encoded format using a key.

-> Decryption: Restore an encrypted message back to its original form using the same key.

-> Simple Interface: Operates through the command line for easy use.

**How to Use**

1. **Run the Program:**


-> Navigate to the folder containing the executable file. // executable folder within the program is named EncryptionApp.exe



-> Start the Application:

  ->Upon starting, you will see a welcome message.

  ->Follow the prompts to proceed.

2.**Choose an Operation:**

   ->You will be asked whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message:

    ->Press C for encryption.

    ->Press D for decryption.

    ->Enter the Key:

    ->Provide an encryption key (any string of your choice).

    ->Remember this key, as you will need it for decryption.

    ->Input the Message:

    ->For encryption: Enter the message you want to secure.

    ->For decryption: Enter the encrypted string generated by this tool.

    ->Get the Result:

    *If encrypting: The program will output the encrypted message.

    *If decrypting: The program will output the original message if the correct key is provided.

3.Exit the Program:

->After completing your task, the program will prompt you to press a key to close it.

**Important Notes**

Key Sensitivity: The encryption key is case-sensitive and must be remembered. Losing the key will make it impossible to decrypt the message.

Encrypted Message Format:

Encrypted messages are encoded into a sequence of numbers separated by dashes (-).

Do not modify the encrypted message before decryption.

The other party must have the same encryption key and use the same program when decrypthing. Simply type in the decryption key and the message that have been encrypthed to decrypth it.

Intended Use: This program is designed for educational purposes and should not be used to secure sensitive or critical data.

Troubleshooting

Invalid Input: If you provide incorrect input (e.g., entering an empty key), the program will prompt you to re-enter.

Decryption Errors: Ensure that the encrypted message and the key match exactly as they were during encryption.
